# Frogfrogfrog Variaton

Ima Williams

Created a variations of games for the frogfrogfrog game. All three versions have the same game mechanic in which all you need to do is move the frog left and right with the arrow keys on the keyboard and use the spacebar to launch the tongue. Simple enough right.. Well no. There are now 3 variation.

Introducing HyperSpeed

Hyperspeed is a variation in which the flies are starting at a quick paste, but the regular black flies are not alone. There are 2 extra flies. A silver and a gold. The silver seems pretty big compared to the other flies, so I will call it the trickster. It is there to have different thing happen. Upon eating the silver fly hypermode is activated. The game becomes extremely fast and you need to collect all the flies in such a speed. It's ridiculous and hard to keep track of. But the trickster has another trick in Hypermode if you eat it you lose. Good luck trying to eat regularly. Second fly is the golden fly that sparkles and has a trail. It must mean something. The golden fly is the savior, it is zipping at a ridiculous speed. If you manage to eat it you automatically win. Now that is what I call a golden opportunity. Eat as much flies as you can while having the golden flies or silverflies assist or stop you.

Patience is Key

A game that requires patience. You need alot not to rage quit on the frog. The game is extremely slow and the goal is to catch as much flies as you can. There are hints. Eating flies consecutively give you a bit of n idea of what you need to do. Eating 3 flies in a  row gives you a three streak and 5 fives give you another streak and a floating text that runs from you. Interactive and rude. The goal is to eat 10 consecutive flies and fill the hungry frog. However if you can keep a streak 3 and above you lose.  You need to always eat 3 or more flies in a row. 10 wins the game. But there is a trick, the flies run away from you. They repel, good luck eating them now and keeping your patience with this game. Enjoy the music and try to fill the frog.

Two Heads is better than One

Have you ever heard the saying two heads is better than one. Well it's true. Eat flies and gain allies as you aim for the highest score. The main frog eating the flies calles allies that can assist him by launching their tongues. Each border frog have their own keys to launch the frog. Top = W, Top-Left = Q, top-right = E, left = A, right = D, bottom-left = Z and bottom-right = C. Use all the frog to eat as much flies as you can as the flies are flying and jittering like crazy and respawning at a fast rate. But there are red flies buzzing around. At first they do nothing but look like a pest. They fly randomly and teleport as well. Well these flies become deadly when all your allies are present and accounted for. Eating the red flies takes away your allies. Once you lose everyone.. Well you literally lose. You are left on your lonesome with no help. Eat as much as you can before your alies are terminated.
