Variaton Jam Idea

Eating one fly can cause the fly to multiply

Sticking the tongue out of the fly will cause the fly to avoid it(Sorta of like being repelled by the tongue and flying the opposite direction.)

Eating a fly adds another frog head to the screen and both frog can go after the fly(However if the tongues of the different frogs touch you lose)

Instead of the frog tongue reaching out for the fly, the frog can be spitting/shooting flies and the other fly to knock them down.

If the frog eats a fly the fly grows in size (In this case the fly can only be eating once it grows twice. The frog could start out really huge and will only be satisified if the fly is 2 or 3 times bigger in size)

The frog can start off big or the fly can start of small and you would need to hit the flies a couple of times in order to eat them.

Different flies(Red or black) If you touch the Red flies you lose you tongue.

Frog can only eat about 5 or 10 flies in a row and would have to wait. ( As the frog eats more flies it get bigger in size and would need to become thinner or less full in order to continue eating, If the frog eats too much you lose)

Hyper speed mode. ( A mode in which everything goes extremely fast. If I choose this variation I don't believe it should be consider an extra one as it is very simple. Maybe Variaton .5)

Everything can be extremely small and everything get slowly bigger if you are able to eat 2 times. (The game will grow after the frog is able to eat 2 flies)

Fly can reset anywhere on a timely manner

Flies fall from all different direction (Right, Left, Up, Down)

Flies are bouncing of the wall

Flies are the predatory and you are the prey. (Frog can eat the flies but the flies be aiming to for the frogs body.)

Flies can be dropping like a meteor, instead of using the tongue to try and eat them, you just need to catch them fall.(Falling flies catch the flies that are fillin randomly)
