Christie Leung's Art Jam was very interesting. The nice image in the middle with the flowing black hair really gave her a nice serene look. It was especially interesting to be able to change the color of the sky depending on the moving of the mouse on the x axis. The change of the flowers to snow also added the change in season with the color of the background it, really beautiful. It was also really interactive to have the flower petal rotate when the mouse was at last point on the x axis in the canvas and by it moving up and down on the y axis. It was really cool. However there was one thing I did not understand. The code talked about the cheeks changing color when the mouse was pressed, but that was not the case. I don't know if the code was off or of something went wrong. It was a bit disappoint to read the code and see that cool function, only for it not to work. Besides that overall the Artjam was beautifully done.
