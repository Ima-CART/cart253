Christie Leung's Art Jam was very interesting. The nice image in the middle with the flowing black hair really gave her a nice serene look. It was especially interesting to be able to change the color of the sky depending on the moving of the mouse on the x axis. The change of the flowers to snow also added the change in season with the color of the background it, really beautiful. It was also really interactive to have the flower petal rotate when the mouse was at last point on the x axis in the canvas and by it moving up and down on the y axis. It was really cool. However there was one thing I did not understand. The code talked about the cheeks changing color when the mouse was pressed, but that was not the case. I don't know if the code was off or of something went wrong. It was a bit disappoint to read the code and see that cool function, only for it not to work. Besides that overall the Artjam was beautifully done.

Lucas Meldrum's Art Jam is exactly as he said, its fun and interactive. I find it more cool than silly, althought I can understand why he would believe people would think it is silly. Althought, it does not look like a self portrait it is a portrait in a different sense. It could be a portrayal of one mind and how complex and all over the place it is. Being watched and feeling that you are always being watch. So its a portrait in a different sense. Having the mini eye move and follow the direction of the mouse was indeed creepy and interesting, as if someone was always watching you movement. I do wish the big eyes followed the mouse as well to keep the consistency, but the big eye was always moving. I found it fascinating to have the giant sphere pulse whenevr I clicked the mouse and change color. It was fun just to click the sphere and see the color change and it pulse. The sphere felt like an interactive game as you were able to rotate it by click and dragging the mouse one direction or the other. The whole canvas was always shifting and changing so there always felt like there was something to do. The could for this project was indeed intense. There was so many things going on, with the color changes of the mini eye and the background. They were never the same but the complimented each other. When it came to the placement of all the mini eyes everywhere I don't think I understood the code. It works wonderfully however I don't know how Lucas was able to place all those mini sphere perfectly around a giant sphere. It's beyond complex for me. But it's interesting to see the different kinds of codes and see how they can be used, especially the p in front of the x and the y.There was so many new functions for this project and explains the complexity of the art jam.

Ashmitha Kanagiah's Art Jam is an adorable smiling Lady with different change variables. I enjoyed being able to hover over the cheeks and have the both cheek change color.It did not matter which cheek I hover over, the both change color. Having to press the mouse and see the color change was also very interesting. Besides those 2 functions there was not much to do. The bow change on it's own without any interaction and the bubble in the back appeared at random, that as well there was not much interaction. The bow change was really subtle, it was only the middle circle which grew, it would have been cooler if the whole bow would have grown. The color change of both was a nice touch. Beside that there was not much to say else to say. I wish there was a bit more things to interact with. The codes explain everything that the art jam was needed to do. It was interesting seeing the triangle function. I would have thought the triangle function would have been three points in order to create the bow, I was not expecting the see 6 points in order to create a triangle. That was a new one. Reading the arc function for the eyes, nose and mouth it was interesting to see the PI being put in play instead of regular numbers and degree. It was a learning process seeing how codes can be used in different ways to get a similar result. A nice Radiant Art Jam for a forever happy and smiling lady.
