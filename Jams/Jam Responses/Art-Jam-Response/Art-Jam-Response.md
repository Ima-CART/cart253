Christie Leung's Art Jam was very interesting. The nice image in the middle with the flowing black hair really gave her a nice serene look. I really enjoyed what she did with the curls of the hair. It was impressive to learn from her codes that they were all black circles and she used a second background circles to cover up the first black circles to make it look like curls. She was able to keep the consistency of the curls and background as the mouse variable changed the season. I especially loved the change in the season with the snow and flowers. I enjoyed being able to move the mouse along the x-axis to see the season change from spring to winter. Having the flower changed to snow as the background change colors added to to the feel of seasonal change, which was really beautiful. When the flowers completely covered the snow, it was fun to have the petals rotate when the condition for all the flowers on the screen has been met, and you move the mouse along the y-axis. I played a bit with the speed to see how fast or slow it can go and it really depened on the mouse *0.1. I love how interactived this Art Jam was. There was so many things to do and the change of it all was interesting. One last thing that I would not have learned was the change in the cheek. By pressing the c key to make the cheeks darker and the r key to reset was a surprise. Without reading the code, I would never have learned there was such a function. Christie was able to incorporate everything to make a really interactive serene Art Jam. It was beautifully done.

Lucas Meldrum's Art Jam is exactly as he said, its fun and interactive. I find it more cool than silly. Althought, it does not look like a self portrait. It is a portrait in a different sense. It could be a portrayal of one mind and how complex and all over the place it is. Being watched and feeling that you are always being watch. Having the mini eye move and follow the direction of the mouse was indeed creepy and interesting, as if someone was always watching your every movement. I do wish the big eyes followed the mouse as well to keep the consistency, but the big eye was always moving around the sphere. It was fun to start of by clicking the mouse and seeing the big sphere pulsing and the colors of the background and mini sphere changing. The fun continued as I learned that I could rotate the sphere by dragging the sphere left, right, up and down. The sphere felt like an interactive game as I was clicking and holding down the mouse and moving the sphere in all sorts of directions to see the different changes. The whole canvas was always shifting and changing, so it felt like there was always something to do. The code for this project was intense. There was so much going on, the color changing, the random movement of the main eye along the sphere and the mini spheres following the mouse. I really couldn't understand how Lucas was able to put everything together. There was so many codes I did not know and no matter how I tried to read it, I couldn't figure out how the function. He was able to draw so many little sphere with little code. I didn't understand how the draw sphere function worked with the lat, lon, the 90 and -90. I'm sure there is an algorithm for it all. Everything worked well and complimented each other, but it's a complex Art Jam. Lucas Meldrum made a really captivating Art Jam.

Ashmitha Kanagiah's Art Jam is an adorable smiling Lady with different change variables. I enjoyed being able to hover over the cheeks and have the both cheek change color.It did not matter which cheek I hover over, the both change color. Having to press the mouse and see the color change was also very interesting. Besides those 2 functions there was not much to do. The bow change on it's own without any interaction and the bubble in the back appeared at random, that as well there was not much interaction. The bow change was really subtle, it was only the middle circle which grew, it would have been cooler if the whole bow would have grown. The color change of both was a nice touch. Beside that there was not much to say else to say. I wish there was a bit more things to interact with. The codes explain everything that the art jam was needed to do. It was interesting seeing the triangle function. I would have thought the triangle function would have been three points in order to create the bow, I was not expecting the see 6 points in order to create a triangle. That was a new one. Reading the arc function for the eyes, nose and mouth it was interesting to see the PI being put in play instead of regular numbers and degree. It was a learning process seeing how codes can be used in different ways to get a similar result. A nice Radiant Art Jam for a forever happy and smiling lady.
