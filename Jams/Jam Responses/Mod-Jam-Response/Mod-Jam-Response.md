 Christie Leung's Frog game is a nice and adorable game. I really like the song and the ambiance of the game it is really relaxing. The only thing I would say that could contradict the calm ambiance is the day turning to night. It gives you a rush type feeling. Starting from the title screen, I loved the rotation of the lilypad and the lilypad notch. I never knew there was a rotate function in order to have an object rotate. Only the speed is needed to have the object rotate. The instruction screen was well explained and I love the 3 states of frog telling us what to expect. Changing the function of the mouse to keyboard was a nice touch. The mouse no longer control the frog, the left and right key were the new controls. I enjoyed that the spacebar was a main tool. It allowed you to switch the different states of the game, if you won or lose it would allow you to restart the game. At the same time in the game state it was the function that launched the tongue to catch the fly. The sounds that play once the game beginning added to the ambiance. I like the 2 different sounds that was added when the fly or bubble was caught. If the bubble was touch there would be a popping sound and if the fly was catch there would be a sparkle sound. It's addes a nice touch to the game. When you won the background music continue to play, however if you lose you get the cricket sounds. The cricket sound really leaves you filling alone and unable to sleep, it was funny. Having the progress bar fill up in order to keep track, was very helpful. The flies being caught was coded differently then I thought. There was already an indication of 0 flies in the beginning, and the max flies being 10. I thought the progress bar would increase every 0.1, but Christie used the function flies/maxflies, which leads to the same idea but her function depended on the flies variable she stated in the beginning. What I found most interesting about Christie's code was how she made everything a variable. There was no numbers in the function call unless it was to perform the arithmetic operations. She really took the time to plan everything before moving to the function call. It allows for alot of flexiblilty as she coded the frog on the different states many times. Everything was drawn and there as no image. What was most compleing was the flies. Look at the fly wing variable I saw sizeRatio, which I was not familiar with. She made the wing sizeRatio 0.9 of the flies body, I don't understand how she got that function but it works. Another compelling number was Math.PI, which was used for the arc of the blanket and the mouth, I have no idea what the Math stand for but it worked for the ark. There is always so much to learn when reading code, especially the flies encase in a bubble. I never knew there was a way to write it in the condition if statement to have it appear 40% of the time and at random. Christie game may look simple but there is so much incorporated in the game. All to have the 10 flies caught before the sky reaches it's night phase. Christie's Good Night Frog is an adorable game which suits the adorable frog she created with all the variable at the beginning of her code.

 Lucas Meldrum's get ready to battle the boss fly game is unexpected, challenging and fun. I loved the beginning which seems to be a nice and easy game until a dialogue was added after I caught the first fly. There was a warning. The warning become more severe after catching the second fly. When the third fly was caught I was shocked and wondering what was going to happen. I never expected Lucas would added a boss battle to his game. The boss battle is challenging but I loved the difficult of it. If there is one thing I would mention to Lucas is to put an instruction screen. Figuring out the tongue release on spacebar is not to hard to figure out but the movement of the frog would be hard to figure out with reading his code or ReadMe. It take away the excitement of the game if you don't know how to move. Out of all the function Lucas used what caught my attention was the jar of flies. It was cool to see the flies that were caught in a jar and move about. The new loop function that was used for the jar is a bit difficult to understand but it allowed the flies to be contain in the jar. The next thing that caught my interest was the boss phase. Looking throught Look code and while playing the game, experiencing the different boss phase felt like playing my old games. The different stages of the Boss got harder. As Phase 2 the boss turn redder and started shooting at you and then phase three the fly was furious and the other flies started to attack. The transition of the flies being a victim and now they attack you with a vengeance is a reallty nice touch. There was sort of difficulty through this one playthrough. Lucas modified the frog game using arrays and loops which is something I am not fully comfortable understanding. Changing the regular flies that fly after before being caught and the summonedflies during the boss phase. And the introduction of the giant fly which moves left and right and the shootprojects flies array. There is so much new codes in which shows that there are other ways to code a program and get a similar result. Lucas's Mod game is an intense game with a good balance of challenge. Although the boss is a  bit difficult to be  but once you know that the fly tracking you can be eaten then it is not to bad.

Ashmitha frog dive game is different from what I expected. Before commenting on the game and the game, I loved the change of the frog. I love how different it was; that is was not a green frog that the rest of us kept. It was a nice pink frog whose eyes follows the mouse. The game being a frog dive in which the more flies you eat allows you to dive deeper in the abyss is cool. Although it is a bit strange to see a fly flying freely in an ocean and diving deeper. As this is the only game without a sound, it felt like something was missing. It was a bit misleading when you see the code for a background sound but there was no sound. I loved the background with the different layers of colors and they way they move in a wave. It gives a good impression that you are indeed underwater. It was the first time I saw a wave function, I believe Ashmitha said it was called perlin noise. There was a wave function with (waveHeight, waveScale, waveColor, waveAddition) the scale and addition are the 2 variables I would like to know how it is used. It's always interesting to learn new functions. I also loved the fishes that appeared in one by one when you clicked the mouse. What is was the most interesting about the fishes was the fact that they were a emoji or a text (and fit nicely in the text box without calling on an image.) I looked to see if it was an images but it was not. Having the progression bar keep track of the progress being made was nice. With all the element it felt nice but the game itself felt a bit lacking.(I found it interesting to see fishes appear in the ocean, after reading the code, due to the mouse being pressed. The appear a random positions.) The fishes appear out of no where was nice, but I wish there was some sort of interaction between the frog and the fish. As for the progressbar although it kept track of the fish you caught there was no indication when the game was reaching it's end. Althought you were diving deeper and deeper, which shows there was progress; I had a moment when I asked myself how long is this game? What is the end goal? These questions were asked before reading the readMe. When the goal was finally reached, the gold mine, I was confused. I did not know that meant you won. I thought it was a sort of bonus level in which you needed to eat the coins or do something extra, but that was not the case. Although the gold mine was reached, you were still able to move the frog and there was no way for you to reset the game. So i figure there was more. A better indication of the game ending would have made the game a bit more interesting. Beside that overall a good game, a couple of things lacking but it was nice to dive into the game and reach the goal mine.
