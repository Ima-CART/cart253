 Christie Leung's Frog game is a nice and adorable game. I really like the song and the ambiance of the game it is really relaxing. The only thing I would say that could contradict the calm ambiance is the day turning to night. It gives you a rush type feeling. I enjoy the addition of the fly in a bubble; you needed to hit it twice in before the frog can consume it. Christie tied in the bubble fly with a nice bubble sound which felt really realistic to a bubble being pop. I also liked the sparkling sound whent he fly was caught, it gives a nice sense of positivity. On the top left screen I really enjoyed the progression bar. It felt like a container being filled and when it is filled the frog can have a good night sleep. The game itself look nice and simple but her code says otherwise. Christie coded everything, to the smallest details. Starting with the fly, she added a wing factor to make it fly but what I found the most interesting was the sizeRatio. I don't understand how Christie came up with the number 0.9 as the size ratio between the fly and the body, but it works. The mouth and the blanket using Math.PI is a new function for me as I don't know what Math is suppose to stand for. I enjoyed the addition of the fly with bubbles appearing randomly, but I never knew there was a function that could let it appear at 40% and it was an if condition that allowed it to appear at random. There is so much to go on about the game. Christie's hardwork is deplayed in the different state of the game, Title, Instruction, Game, Sleeping and Hungry. In each states she redraw the draw and the objects around her and I was shocked to see how long and detailed her code was, it felt like the list can go on, there was not image added, but her design made the frog extremely adorable which suited her game and it kept the transition between each screen really nice and interesting. Christie came up with not only a calm ambiance game, but an adorable one as well.

 Lucas Meldrum's get ready to battle the boss fly game is unexpected, challenging and fun. I loved the beginning which seems to be a nice and easy game until a dialogue was added after I caught the first fly. There was a warning. The warning become more severe after catching the second fly. When the third fly was caught I was shocked and wondering what was going to happen. I never expected Lucas would added a boss battle to his game. The boss battle is challenging but I loved the difficult of it. If there is one thing I would mention to Lucas is to put an instruction screen. Figuring out the tongue release on spacebar is not to hard to figure out but the movement of the frog would be hard to figure out with reading his code or ReadMe. It take away the excitement of the game if you don't know how to move. Out of all the function Lucas used what caught my attention was the jar of flies. It was cool to see the flies that were caught in a jar and move about. The new loop function that was used for the jar is a bit difficult to understand but it allowed the flies to be contain in the jar. The next thing that caught my interest was the boss phase. Looking throught Look code and while playing the game, experiencing the different boss phase felt like playing my old games. The different stages of the Boss got harder. As Phase 2 the boss turn redder and started shooting at you and then phase three the fly was furious and the other flies started to attack. The transition of the flies being a victim and now they attack you with a vengeance is a reallty nice touch. There was sort of difficulty through this one playthrough. Lucas modified the frog game using arrays and loops which is something I am not fully comfortable understanding. Changing the regular flies that fly after before being caught and the summonedflies during the boss phase. And the introduction of the giant fly which moves left and right and the shootprojects flies array. There is so much new codes in which shows that there are other ways to code a program and get a similar result. Lucas's Mod game is an intense game with a good balance of challenge. Although the boss is a  bit difficult to be  but once you know that the fly tracking you can be eaten then it is not to bad.

Ashmitha frog dive game is different from what I expected. Before commenting on the game and the game, I loved the change of the frog. I love how different it was; that is was not a green frog that the rest of us kept. It was a nice pink frog whose eyes follows the mouse. The game being a frog dive in which the more flies you eat allows you to dive deeper in the abyss is cool. Although it is a bit strange to see a fly flying freely in an ocean and diving deeper. As this is the only game without a sound, it felt like something was missing. It was a bit misleading when you see the code for a background sound but there was no sound. I loved the background with the different layers of colors and they way they move in a wave. It gives a good impression that you are indeed underwater. It was the first time I saw a wave function, I believe Ashmitha said it was called perlin noise. There was a wave function with (waveHeight, waveScale, waveColor, waveAddition) the scale and addition are the 2 variables I would like to know how it is used. It's always interesting to learn new functions. I also loved the fishes that appeared in one by one when you clicked the mouse. What is was the most interesting about the fishes was the fact that they were a emoji or a text (and fit nicely in the text box without calling on an image.) I looked to see if it was an images but it was not. Having the progression bar keep track of the progress being made was nice. With all the element it felt nice but the game itself felt a bit lacking. The fishes appear out of no where was nice, but I wish there was some sort of interaction between the frog and the fish. As for the progressbar although it kept track of the fish you caught there was no indication when the game was reaching it's end. Althought you were diving deeper and deepr which shows there was progress; I had a moment when I asked myself how long is this game. What is the end goal. These questions were asked before reading the readMe. When the goal was finally reached, the gold mine, I was confused. I did not know that meant you won. I thought it was a sort of bonus level in which you needed to eat the coins or do something extra, but that was not the case. Although the gold mine was reached, you were still able to move the frog and there was not a way for you to reset the game. So i figure there was more. A better indication of the game end would have made the game a bit more interesting. I found it interesting to see fishes appear in the ocean,
