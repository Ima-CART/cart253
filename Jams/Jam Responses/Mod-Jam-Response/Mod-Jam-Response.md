 Christie Leung's Frog game is a nice and adorable game. I really like the song and the ambiance of the game it is really relaxing. The only thing I would say that could contradict the calm ambiance is the day turning to night. It gives you a rush type feeling. I enjoy the addition of the fly in a bubble; you needed to hit it twice in before the frog can consume it. Christie tied in the bubble fly with a nice bubble sound which felt really realistic to a bubble being pop. I also liked the sparkling sound whent he fly was caught, it gives a nice sense of positivity. On the top left screen I really enjoyed the progression bar. It felt like a container being filled and when it is filled the frog can have a good night sleep. The game itself look nice and simple but her code says otherwise. Christie coded everything, to the smallest details. Starting with the fly, she added a wing factor to make it fly but what I found the most interesting was the sizeRatio. I don't understand how Christie came up with the number 0.9 as the size ratio between the fly and the body, but it works. The mouth and the blanket using Math.PI is a new function for me as I don't know what Math is suppose to stand for. I enjoyed the addition of the fly with bubbles appearing randomly, but I never knew there was a function that could let it appear at 40% and it was an if condition that allowed it to appear at random. There is so much to go on about the game. Christie's hardwork is deplayed in the different state of the game, Title, Instruction, Game, Sleeping and Hungry. In each states she redraw the draw and the objects around her and I was shocked to see how long and detailed her code was, it felt like the list can go on, there was not image added, but her design made the frog extremely adorable which suited her game and it kept the transition between each screen really nice and interesting. Christie came up with not only a calm ambiance game, but an adorable one as well.
