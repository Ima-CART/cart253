 Christie Leung's Frog game is a nice and adorable game. I really like the song and the ambiance of the game it is really relaxing. The only thing I would say that could contradict the calm ambiance is the day turning to night. It gives you a feeling of urgency. Starting from the title screen, I loved the rotation of the lilypad and the lilypad notch. I never knew there was a rotate function call in order to have an object rotate, only the speed is needed. The instruction screen was well explained and I love the 3 states of frog telling us what to expect. Changing the function of the mouse to keyboard was a nice touch. The mouse no longer control the frog, the left and right key were the new controls. I enjoyed that the spacebar was a main tool. It allowed you to switched to different states of the game, if you won or lost it would allow you to restart the game. At the same time, in the game state it was the function that launched the tongue to catch the fly. The sounds that play once the game beginning added to the ambiance. I like the 2 different sounds that was added when the fly or bubble was caught. If the bubble was touched there would be a popping sound and if the fly was caught there would be a sparkle sound. It's adds a nice touch to the game. When you won the background music continued to play, however if you lose you get the cricket sound. The cricket sound really leaves you feelling alone and unable to sleep, it was funny. Having the progress bar fill up in order to keep track, was very helpful. The flies being caught was coded differently then I thought. There was already an indication of 0 flies in the beginning, and the max flies being 10. I thought the progress bar would increase every 0.1, but Christie used the function flies/maxflies, which leads to the same conclusion but her function depended on the flies variable she stated in the beginning. What I found most interesting about Christie's code was how she made everything a variable. There was no numbers in the function call unless it was to perform the arithmetic operations. She really took the time to plan everything before moving to the function call. It allows for alot of flexiblilty as she coded the different states of the frog many times. Everything was drawn and there as no image. The frog was beyond adorable. What was most compleing was the flies. Looking at the fly wing variable I saw sizeRatio, which I was not familiar with. She made the wing sizeRatio 0.9 of the flies body, I don't understand how she got that function but it works. Another compelling number was Math.PI, which was used for the arc of the blanket and the mouth, I have no idea what the Math stand for but it worked for the arc. There is always so much to learn when reading code, especially the flies encased in a bubble. I never knew there was a way to write it in the if condition statement to have it appear 40% of the time and at random. Christie game may look simple but there is so much incorporated in the game. All to have the 10 flies caught before the sky reaches it's night phase and determining if the frog sleep or not. Christie's Good Night Frog is an adorable game which suits the adorable frog she created with all the variable at the beginning of her code.

 Lucas Meldrum's frogfrogfrog is unexpecting, challenging and fun. It starts of simple with a couple of flies flying by, with a jar at the top right of the screen. But the fun starts when the first fly is cause as the game issues you a warning, using the dialogue function call to stop. After the second fly is caught the dialogue gets serious and the after the third fly the dialogue becomes a threat as boss battle is engaged. I never expected a giant fly boss battle, so that was impressive. Hitting the boss was similar to eating flies as the jar at the right corner was still getting filled and the score was increasing. The overlap was kept the same and your score increase as if it was a regular fly. Lucas's game incorporated the array and loop functions which made the game flow nicely even though I still find it a bit difficult to understand. Starting from the Jar, which encased the flies, using the loop function to keep the flies in there but only setting a maxium of 10 felt like the flies were held hostage compared to being eaten. It was impressive to see the change in fly function between the different stages of the game. The first stage the fly is just a normal function call with it moving towards the right. During the third phase the fly function was changed to flies and it became an array instead of a regular call. All the arrays came into play during the stages of the boss battle for the flies and the projectile, that was shot towards the frog. The loop using the i const was also used for the flies and projectile. I felt it added for easy control of the flies and projectile that was aim towards the frog. However the summonedFlies that were honing towards the flies was really impressive. I was learning alot from Lucas codes, it shows he has really grasp and knowledge for coding. I can not forgot the most important aspect of the game, the boss phases. The boss phases starts out intensive with the background music changing to an intense music compared to the calm nature outdoor sound. The giant flies with the function going back and forth, right if the x was less than equal to zero or left if x was greater than equal to the width. I would never have thought that all you needed was to add a - in order to have the direction change, I would have believe you needed to be a bit more precise  with the direction but that was not the case. Experiencing the stages of the boss battle getting more intense when boss health decrease with an increment of 10 and the boss shades become a darker shade of red made me nervous. The boss was not going to be simple. Reaching the second phase and having the projectile shot at the flies and then phase 3 having different flies honing on you added alot of difficult. After playing the game a couple of time I found there was a way to predict the projectile and avoid it, but the summonedflies was a different matter. You can eat the flies but it was hard to focus on that and taking down the boss at the game time. Challenging as it was the game was fun and well done. If there is one thing I would comment about is the instruction page and the controls. As the controls was change to the keycode(left)=a/A and (right)=d/D, it would have been better to mention that in the beginning. The tongue was not to hard to guess that to launch it was the keycode spacebar, but if no one reads the code or the readme they would be stuck for a couple of minutes touching all the keypad and mouse to figure out how to move and attack. Besides that an impressive game from Lucas. From the frog being the hunter to the hunted was ironic at the end.

Ashmitha frog dive game is different from what I expected. Before commenting on the game and the code, I loved the change of the frog. I love how different it was; that is was not a green frog that the rest of us kept. It was a nice pink frog whose eyes follows the mouse using the call map. The game being a frog dive in which the more flies you eat allows you to dive deeper in the abyss is cool. Although it is a bit strange to see a fly flying freely in an ocean and diving deeper. As this is the only game without sound, it felt like something was missing. It was a bit misleading when you saw the code for a background sound but there was no sound, apparently there was issue according to the commit.  I loved the background with the different layers of colors and they way they move in a wave. It gives a good impression that you are indeed underwater. It was the first time I saw a wave function, I believe Ashmitha said it was called perlin noise. There was a wave function with (waveHeight, waveScale, waveColor, waveAddition), the scale and addition are the 2 variables I would like to know how it is used. It's always interesting to learn new functions. I also loved the fishes. Ashmitha use the array function to call on the fishes when the mouse is pressed. The fishes, although consider a text, had their own movement and bounced around the screen at different speeds. It was like being in a fish tank. What was the most interesting about the fishes was the fact that they were an emoji or a text and it fit nicely in the text box without calling on an image. Having the progression bar keep track of the progress being made was nice. If the conditions was met depending on how many flies where caught, you would dive deeper in the ocean and it got darker and darker, until you reached the gold mine. All the different elements felt nice but the game itself felt a bit lacking. The fishes appear out of no where was nice, but I wish there was some sort of interaction between the frog and the fish. As for the progress bar although it kept track of the fish you caught there was no indication when the game was reaching it's end. Althought you were diving deeper and deeper, which shows there was progress; I had a moment when I asked myself how long is this game? What is the end goal? These questions were asked before reading the readMe. When the goal was finally reached, the gold mine, I was confused. I did not know it meant you won. I thought it was a sort of bonus level in which you needed to eat the coins or do something extra, but that was not the case. Although the gold mine was reached, you were still able to move the frog and there was no way for you to reset the game. So i figure there was more. A better indication of the game ending would have made the game a bit more interesting. Beside that overall a good game, a couple of things lacking but it was nice to dive into the game and reach the gold mine.
