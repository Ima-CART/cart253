Add another insect to disrupt the game(the second insect can be a bumble bee or a tiny mostquito)

Catching the second insect would decrease points(If fly would increase the number, how would the second insect decrease the number)

The second insect could move randomly(Use the random variable to have the second insect move randomly. It can even overlap the fly and see what happens)

There can be a swamp background instead of a blue one(Draw a different background with a lake in the middle and a couple of long tall grass. Or maybe even long fox tail, reeds,catt etc..)

There is a nest on the right to count the number of flies caught (The nest can be seen as a counter for the flies caught. It could even be a basket...(Hard to create))

If the second insect is caught the frog would change color (The frog's color can be changed from green->blue->purple->red-> and maybe black can be the final color)

The regular flies can return the frog back to normal slowly (catching the fly can have the frogs color work in the opposite direction as what was shown in the top line where it regains its strenght black->red->purple->blue->green being regular)

You can only eat the bees 3 times before the frog completely dies (Once the frog colro becomes black it would be considred game over. Maybe instead of 3 bad insect it can be 4 or 5)

The tongue can move from different direction instead on just straight ( The variable and the position of the tongue would need to be changed in order to allow for flexibility)

Try to make the frog look a bit more realistic with images (Instead of having a green circle, an image of a frog outline can be used instead)

The background could also change from day to night(Depending on how long the games goes on the sky can get darker, maybe a moon and start can appear)

If it becomes dark the bees can be change to a mini bat instead(The second insect can become a large creature which would make the game become a bit difficult as the game drags on)

If the frog eat the wrong creature or insect the tongue can also be affected(If the frog eats the wrong creaure or insect the tongue could get thinner or it could also not reach as long. The y of the tongue can get smaller to add a bit more difficulty )

If the sky turns dark the flies could fly faster(To make the game more difficult the flies could have a faster speed and velocity to make the game harder.)

At night the mini bat can also eat the flies (The bat fly at random can also have an interation with the flie. When the bat and the fly touch or over lap the flies disappear. But the fly can only eat one fly at a time.)

The frog can be hidden behind the fox tails or the grasses in the pond( It makes it more fun if the flies are not able to see what coming)

Maybe add a lilypad in which the frog can be able to climb ( Add lilypad in which the frog can climb or sit on in order to catch the flies quicker. However the frog will be a much easier target for the second creatures attacks.)

The frog can be move with a Keyboard and the tongue can be release with the space bar instead ( Change the function of the mouse into a keyboard. For better engagement with the back. Although the idea would be more for a computer game in which ipad and phones can not be used. The tongue can be released with the pressing of the space bar instead of a mouse click.)

The frog can have both the mouse and the keyboard function. (The mouse can move the frog while the keyboard can be pressed to get the flies. Or the Keyboard can be used to move the frog around and the mousepress can be used to catch the flies
)

If the fly is caught while the second creature touches the tongue but the tongue can return. The fly is released (The second creature can disrupt the catching process as the tongue needs a bit of time to return the the frogs mouth.)

Ideas outside the frog

The frog can be a different animal throwing things at the target(I was thinking of a squirrel throwing a nut at a fly or a bird.)

Continuing the ideas of throwing things. I was thinking of a hand Throwing ninja starts at a target(The hand or small ninja can throw ninja starts at an enemy or a target for target practice)

When the bird is hit by the nut it can just fall. (The bird will stop its fly and just fall to the ground until it disappears)

There can be trees that appears to block the squirrel( Hitting the trees either drops the nut or nothing happens.)

The squirrel feels as though it is moving and finding birds and tree(It will be hard to create a function in which the squirrels like it is moving inside the screen and random obstacles are appearing. Don't know if idea is possible)

It can also be a soccer ball with a moving next and you need to hit the ball to score(The soccer call can be aimed at a net in which goals are scored whent he soccer ball goes inside the net. The ball needs to go inside the net and not the sides)

The soccer balls can have tshirt blocking the goals(The tshirt is a small indication of another person)

Hitting the tshirt can cause the ball to fall down on the y axis(If the ball hits a shirt a the ball and the tshirt falls on the yaxis until the both disappear.)
