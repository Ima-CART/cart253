# Description
This is a game about catching flies and trying to stay alive. The game starts simple with a frog trying to catch flies. However the challenge starts after the frog catches 5 flies. An intrusive bumblebee comes in and disrupt the frog. The bumblebee moves at random and is able to eat catch the flies. There is no way to get rid of the bumblebee, touching it will make the frog sick. The frog is can only eat what is not a fly three times before the game ends and it dies. The fun does not stop there, the sky changes from day time to night time. When the sky becomes dark the bumblebee goes to rest and a wild bat swoops in to cause trouble. There is no simple or easy way for the frog to eat its meal. The same concept applies to the bat, as eating it 3 times will cause the game to end. The only why to hang on and save yourself is to eat as many flies as you can. Eating flies will allow the frog to heal and regain it's strength.

Functions of the game
The frog can move left and right by moving the left and the right keys.
The bumblebee starts off as inactive for the first 5 flies. After eating 5 flies it will come in and problem when a the frog eats it instead of the fly. The bumblebee will move at random and will stay within the screen. It will restart if it reaches any of the extremes. 
The bumblebee can also eat the flies. Eating the flies will can them to reset at random
Eating the bumblebee will slowly turn the frog black. At the same time if the bumblebee also touches the frog, the frog will slowly turn black.
The background changes from day to night with the sky getting dark enough to turn to night time.
Once the sky becomes dark the bumblebee is no longer active and the hidden bat will become active. The bat swoops in with great speed and can also eat flies. 
Eating or touching the bat wil cause the frog to change color before it completely croaks for good.
Eating flies is the only slavation as it can revert the frog back to normal.
Staying alive is the most important aspect for the frog.

-For this project I have learned how to use active by talking with Prof. Pippin Baar, which has allowed me to make the bumblebee and the bat active at different stages of the game.
-Bezier is a function that was learned from p5js.org in order to create the grass.
