Add another insect to disrupt the game
Catching the second insect would decrease points
The second insect could move randomly
There can be a swamp background instead of a blue one
There is a nest on the right to count the number of flies caught
If the second insect is caught the frog would change color
The regular flies can return the frog back to normal slowly
You can only eat the bees 3 times before the frog completely dies
The tongue can move from different direction instead on just straight
Try to make the frog look a bit more realistic with images






Ideas outside the frog
The frog can be an different animal throwing things at the target
It can also be a soccer ball with a moving next and you need to hit the ball to score
