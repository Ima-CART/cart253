## Description

Here is a portrait of Ima with an background and tshirt that changes colors. What makes the portrait is that unless the mouse is staying still something is always happening.

There is a variable in the fill of the tshirt which cause it to change color depening on where the mouse cursor is.
There is also a condition for the background depening where the mouse moves on the x-axis. 

It's a simple portait using simple function in order to get the main outline of the portrait. The complication starts when adding the hair and a couple of the facial features as there are codes I have learned for p5js.org in order to further my knowledge and understanding.

The Changing background portrait is meant to express that a person has different color and persepective. Just my moving the mouse is the same as moving around it the world to experience different colors, but at the same time adding all the colors a person has.
